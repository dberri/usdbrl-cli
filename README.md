# Cotacao CLI

Cotacao CLI is a tool that allows developers to fetch the exchange rate of USD/BRL on the 15th 
workday of the previous month.

To file taxes in Brazil for foreign earnings, one needs to convert that income to USD using the
closed exchange rate of the payment date and then convert to BRL using the exchange rate on the 15th 
workday of the previous month.

The data comes from the oficial website for the [Brazilian Central Bank](https://www4.bcb.gov.br/pec/taxas/port/ptaxnpesq.asp?frame=1)
